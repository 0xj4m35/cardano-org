The core technology teams collaborated with Sundae Labs and Well-Typed to assess Ouroboros Leios' feasibility and began integrating `ouroboros-network` for Mithril. The networking team plans to discontinue non-P2P support post-next hard fork and has ceased support for node-to-client versions below 16. The consensus team reviewed UTXO-HD pull requests and discussed hard fork combinator simplifications. The Plutus team advanced certified compilation tools and the Data-encoded ScriptContext API. Mithril released distribution 2445.0, enhancing Cardano node v.10.1 support and aggregator metrics. Hydra focused on incremental commits and Aiken validator rewrites. Intersect's budget committee is set to allocate Cardano treasury funds for 2025.
