Just a demo for the news section based the [blog plugin of Docusaurus](https://docusaurus.io/docs/api/plugins/@docusaurus/plugin-content-blog).

Simply add Markdown files (or folders) to the `blog` directory.

Regular blog authors can be added to `authors.yml`. Multiple authors possible per news article.

The blog post date can be extracted from filenames, such as:

- `2019-05-30-welcome.md`
- `2019-05-30-welcome/index.md`

Also nice: a blog post folder can be convenient to co-locate blog post images:

The blog supports tags as well!
