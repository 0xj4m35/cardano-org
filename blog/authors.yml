# please only add regular authors, you can also add one-off authors in the news files directly.
# todo: Would be nice to start with a decent group of regular authors / entities 
#
# obv need some guidelines. Suggestions for content we will like and merge:
# 1.) Call to action/participation
# 2.) eli5 a topic (financial, regulation, legal, governance, infrastructure, operations, resilience, development, network)
#     recap a physical (bigger) meetup, a workshop, a working group workstream, a vote/poll/survey/, governance actions
# 3.) content we will not give visibility: sales, promotion, announcement of announcements, new tokens/platforms/apps/services
#     promises, best/first/largest/fastest whatnot
# 4.) TLDR: Focus on things that benefit the community rather than an individual/company, needs to link always back 
#     to a blog/news article
