# Website

Welcome to the cardano.org website. We believe that this website should be managed by a collective and not a single entity. For this to be successful, the website relies on your contributions. 


### Installation

This website is built using [Docusaurus](https://docusaurus.io/), a modern static website generator. This will get you up and running:

```
$ git clone git@github.com:katomm/www-cardano-revamp.git && cd www-cardano-revamp && yarn install  
```

### Local Development

```
$ yarn start
```

This command starts a local development server and opens up a browser window. Most changes are reflected live without having to restart the server.

### Build

```
$ yarn build
```

This command generates static content into the `build` directory and can be served using any static contents hosting service. Always build the site once before firing a pull request.
