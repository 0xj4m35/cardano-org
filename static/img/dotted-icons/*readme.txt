To make a new dotted icon use the template-dotted-icons.svg file.

The file has been made in open source vector graphic software Inkscape.

In Inkscape, make sure that the rectangular grid is enabled and visible in file > document properties.

Turn on snapping to grid in snapping options (top right of app window in Inkscape 1.3.2)

Use pencil tool to draw the icon with a stroke width of 5 px with a round "join" and round "cap".

The colors in the template are already set to follow the cardano branding guidelines which at the moment of writing these instructions are the following values for Inkscape 

Blue icon : R : 0 G : 51 B : 173 A : 100 
Background dot grid : R : 255 G : 85 B : 83 A : 100

Please delete all the dots that are hidden under the icon to make the SVG file lighter and prevent potential issues.

It is important to remain playful and creative and one could for example color some dots blue if this helps making a better, more meaningful icon. Maybe you have other ideas.

While these instructions are for the current grid system, if you think you can design a better grid system than the current one, create it, and submit your ideas to the community. Collaborate.

Some icons currently have a different grid system, which allows for more slanted designs. This template was made for the more rigid and square grid because it is the one that most of the icons use. But why not make a template for the slanted, more relaxed grid style ? Or take inspiration from it and redesign all the icons.
